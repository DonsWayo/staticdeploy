StaticDeploy allows for a variety of workflows for the continuous integration,
delivery, and deployment of a static app.

To implement them, first of all we should set up our CI server to build the app
and create a bundle for the build on each commit. We can choose to tag the
bundle with the name of the branch our commit was added to, or even with the sha
of the commit. For instance, for a
[react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in our CI server we
could do something like:

```sh
# Build the app, saving static artifacts into the build/ folder
npm run build
# Create a bundle from that folder
staticdeploy create-bundle \
  --from build/
  --name example-app \
  --tag $BRANCH \
  --description "Build of commit $COMMIT"
```

Then, we could choose to:

- automatically deploy each branch to `$BRANCH.example-app.com/`:

  ```sh
  staticdeploy deploy
    --app example-app
    --entrypoint $BRANCH.example-app.com/
    --bundle example-app:$BRANCH
  ```

- automatically deploy git tags to `example-app.com/$TAG/` (can be useful for
  versioning documentation websites):

  ```sh
  staticdeploy deploy
    --app example-app
    --entrypoint example-app.com/$TAG/
    --bundle example-app:$TAG
  ```

- automatically deploy `master` to the production environment:

  ```sh
  staticdeploy deploy
    --app example-app
    --entrypoint example-app.com/
    --bundle example-app:master
  ```

- manually deploy to production using StaticDeploy's admin console
