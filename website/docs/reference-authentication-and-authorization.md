## Authentication

Before calling the StaticDeploy Management API, a user needs to get an
authentication token that certifies their identity. StaticDeploy is not an
identity provider (IdP), so an external IdP is needed to issue such tokens, that
StaticDeploy is then able to verify.

Currently StaticDeploy ships with two strategies for verifying tokens, that
enable support for two types of identity providers:

- **OpenID Connect IdPs** - such as Azure Active Directory or GitHub - that
  issue Json Web Tokens (JWTs) using the OpenID Connect protocol. These tokens
  are verified by StaticDeploy with its OpenID Connect strategy. Users can
  obtain such tokens via the StaticDeploy Management Console, simply by clicking
  on the _Login with \${provider}_ button
- **IdPs that issue JWTs _in some other way_**. These tokens are verified by
  StaticDeploy with its JWT strategy. Users have to manually obtain such tokens,
  which they can then use with the StaticDeploy Management Console, or with the
  StaticDeploy CLI

## Authorization

</div>

Once the user has an authentication token, they can call the Management API
(using the Management Console or the CLI). The authentication token contains two
key pieces of information:

- `idp`: the name of the identity provider that issued the token
- `idpId`: the user id for the identity provider

StaticDeploy uses these two parameters to find the _user object_ corresponding
to the user.

> **Note**: if no corresponding user object is found, one is created on the fly.

The user object contains some StaticDeploy-specific information about the user,
such as the groups the user belongs to. Groups are collections of roles, simple
strings that allow performing certain operations (see below for details). The
user groups, and therefore roles, are then used by the authorizer to determine
whether the user is allowed or not to perform the operation for which they have
called the Management API.

## Roles

StaticDeploy authorizes operations using the following roles:

- `root`: allows performing all operations
- `reader`: allows performing all read operations (currently there are no
  finer-grained roles for read access)
- `app-manager:id`: allows performing the following operations on the app with
  the specified id:
  - updating the app
  - deleting the app
  - creating entrypoints linked to the app (provided the necessary
    `entrypoint-manager` role)
- `entrypoint-manager:urlMatcher`: allows performing the following operations on
  the entrypoint with the specified url matcher:
  - creating the entrypoint (provided the necessary `app-manager` role for the
    app the entrypoint links to)
  - updating the entrypoint
  - deleting the entrypoint
- `bundle-manager:name`: allows performing the following operations on bundles
  with the specified name:
  - creating a bundle
  - deleting a bundle

> **Note on the `entrypoint-manager` role**: the target `urlMatcher` is actually
> a pattern matching many url matchers (a url-matcher matcher). For example:
>
> - the pattern `example.com/` allows managing entrypoints with url matcher:
>   - `example.com/`
>   - `example.com/foo/`
>   - `example.com/foo/bar/`
>   - etc
> - the pattern `example.com/foo/` allows managing entrypoints with url matcher:
>   - `example.com/foo/`
>   - `example.com/foo/bar/`
>   - etc
> - the pattern `*.example.com/` allows managing entrypoints with url matcher:
>   - `foo.example.com/`
>   - `foo.example.com/foo/`
>   - `foo.bar.example.com/`
>   - etc
> - the pattern `*example.com/` allows managing entrypoints with utl matchers:
>   - `example.com/`
>   - `example.com/foo/`
>   - `foo.example.com/`
>   - `fooexample.com/` (not a subdomain of example.com)
>   - etc
