# staticdeploy-static-server

staticdeploy static server.

## Run

To run the service, first compile the source code with `yarn compile`, then run
it with `yarn start`.

You can check the health status of the service via `GET /health`: the server
will return a `200` if the service is in a healthy status, a `503` otherwise.
The (json) body of the response contains details about the health status. When a
valid `access_token` is provided in the request querystring, more status details
are returned.

## Configure

The following environment variables can be used to configure the server:

> General service configurations

* `NODE_ENV` (defaults to `development`)
* `LOG_LEVEL` (defaults to `info`)
* `PORT` (defaults to `3000`): network port to attach to
* `HEALTH_ROUTE_HOSTNAME`: hostname to make health-check requests to
* `HEALTH_ROUTE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: token that allows getting the detailed health
  status of the service

> Storage configurtations

* `STORAGE_DATABASE_URL`: storage database connection string, defaults to
  `sqlite://:memory:`
* `STORAGE_DEPLOYMENTS_PATH`: storage deployments path, defaults to
  `${tmpdir()}/staticdeploy/deployments`
