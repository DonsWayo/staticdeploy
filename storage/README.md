# @staticdeploy/storage

Module proxying access to storage resources. The module is used by the
**api-server**, which uses it to read from and write to the storage, and by the
**static-server**, which uses it to read from the storage.

Currently StaticDeploy uses S3 (or any API compatible alternative) to store
static files, and either [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) ot
[postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) to store metadata about the files, as
well as the other entities of StaticDeploy.
