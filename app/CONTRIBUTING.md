## Develop

> *Prerequisites*: have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) **> 8** and
> [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.

To get started developing the service:

- install dependencies with `yarn`

Then you can either:

- `yarn dev`: starts the development server
- `yarn test`: runs tests
- `yarn test --coverage`: runs tests, calculates code coverage
- `yarn lint`: runs code linters
- `yarn prettify`: formats code with prettier

> **NOTE**: this project uses [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
> to enforce code formatting. Installing the prettier extension for your editor
> of choice is **highly recommended**.
